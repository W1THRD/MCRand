# MCRand

A little minecraft text randomizer! I'm not sure if it works on Linux or Mac, but it certainly works on Windows. It requires the latest version of Python to work, but that's it. It currently has a 1.19.3 template ready for putting into Minecraft 1.19.3, all you need to do is run main.py.

## How to use

1. Download all the files and put them in the same folder
2. Make sure the /default folder is contained in the same directory as the main.py file.
3. Run Main.py. It will put the randomized data in /Pack.
4. Now, put the Pack folder into your .minecraft/resourcepacks folder, and load into the game
5. Enable the resource pack in settings, and enjoy!

## Easier instructions
If you don't want to run the python script, you can just use the pre-made randomized pack:
1. Download the files
2. Put the Pack folder into your .minecraft/resourcepacks folder, and load into the game
3. Enable the resource pack in settings, and enjoy!


## Current features:
- Randomizes small text (anything contained in assets/minecraft/lang/en_us.json)
- Randomizes large texts (anything contained in assets/minecraft/texts/, excluding Minecraft's credits)
- Textures under the minecraft namespace (not realms) of these categories: block, effect, item, map, mob_effect, particle

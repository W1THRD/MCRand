A little minecraft text randomizer! I'm not sure if it works on Linux or Mac, but it certainly works on Windows. It requires the latest version of Python to work, but that's it. It currently has a 1.19.3 template ready for putting into Minecraft 1.19.3, all you need to do is run main.py.

## How to use

1. Download all the files and put them in the same folder
2. Make sure the input.json file is in the same folder as main.py. This should contain the original Minecraft text.
3. Run Main.py. It will put the randomized data in /Pack.
4. Now, put the Pack folder into your .minecraft/resourcepacks folder, and load into the game
5. Enable the resource pack in settings, and enjoy!
